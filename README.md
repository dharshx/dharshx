🎓 I'm a passionate software developer and data enthusiast currently pursuing my Master's in Information Systems at the University of Texas at Arlington. 

🚀 My skills include web development, data analytics, and programming in Python, C, C++, and JavaScript. I have experience in designing and developing web and mobile applications.

### 🔭 What I'm Up To

🌐 I'm currently working on a project that involves developing a web application for data visualization and analysis using React.js, Node.js, and MySQL. It's a challenging yet exciting project that allows me to apply my skills in full-stack web development and data analytics.

### 🌱 What I'm Learning

I'm constantly learning and exploring new technologies to improve my skills and stay up-to-date with industry trends.
